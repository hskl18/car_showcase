# Car Showcase Web App üöó

Welcome to my car showcase project web app, developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This application is a demonstration of the power of Next.js and its server rendering capabilities. I embarked on this journey after learning from a comprehensive [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU&t=9263s).

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and showcases a variety of cars for enthusiasts and potential buyers.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get the project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Feel free to modify `app/page.tsx` to make changes. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Font Optimization**: This project leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
